## Since then...
### Let's party!!

### When?
09/01/2015 from 14:00 to the breakfast of day after (14 pm, we have lazy breakfast).

### Where?
Mauro and Irene house. (Esmoreitstraat 9hs)

### What?
Let's say is a Pigiama~party!
You can bring nice things like:
food (not too much, we don't like to waste it and there would be some),

drinks

company

happiness

smile

music

etc... etc...


The house would be Open to our friends :-)
So that means that you can bring your own friend.


I will cook somethings meanwhile we are talking and drinking.
Would not be really dinner.
Is more what is ready, is ready to be eat!
Kind of Marathon Kitchen;

indeed you are welcome to help with it and make some delicatesse together.
